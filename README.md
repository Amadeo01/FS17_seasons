# FS17 Seasons

This mod inplements the following:
- Seasonal darkness/hours of daylight. It is longer dark in the winter than in the summer
- 7 day weather forecast with temperatures, season and weather
- updates to the economy to make this all survivable: realistic income (crops) and expenses (workers, maintenance)

- Wages have been changed. The AI now costs 1650 per hour between 6AM and 6PM on monday until friday. Outside those ours, in overtime, they get paid 2475 per hour (150%)

- seasonal weather. In the winter it's cold and cloudy and it snows and hails. In autumn it is rainy, and in the summer it is warm and the sun shines.
- seasonal crop growth. You can't grow certain crops when it is too cold. Some crops might even die in the winter. Growth speed of the crop is also decided by the the tenperature and weather


Maintenance
- Age in maintenance GUI is now days since last repair
- New maintenance algorithm with repair, maintenance and taxes
- Keep your machine clean to lower daily maintenance costs
- Machine not used? Pay less
- You can repair your vehicles at the vehicle workshop (placeable or on the map). It is more expensive at the dealer
